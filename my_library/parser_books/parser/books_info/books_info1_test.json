From there, you can insert, combine, or adapt the code to help construct your application. Recipes also include a discussion that explains the solution and provides meaningful context. This cookbook takes you beyond theory and concepts by providing the nuts and bolts you need to construct working machine learning applications.\n\nYou’ll find recipes for:\n● Vectors, matrices, and arrays\n● Handling numerical and categorical data, text, images, and dates and times\n● Dimensionality reduction using feature extraction or feature selection\n● Model evaluation and selection\n● Linear and logical regression, trees and forests, and k-nearest neighbors\n● Support vector machines (SVM), naïve Bayes, clustering, and neural networks\n● Saving and loading trained models\n\nWho This Book Is For\nThis book is not an introduction to machine learning. If you are not comfortable with the basic concepts of machine learning or have never spent time learning machine learning, do not buy this book. Instead, this book is for the machine learning practitioner who, while comfortable with the theory and concepts of machine learning, would benefit from a quick reference containing code to solve challenges he runs into working on machine learning on an everyday basis.\nThis book assumes the reader is comfortable with the Python programming language and package management.\n\nWho This Book Is Not For\nAs stated previously, this book is not an introduction to machine learning. This book should not be your first. If you are unfamiliar with concepts like cross-validation, random forest, and gradient descent, you will likely not benefit from this book as much as one of the many high-quality texts specifically designed to introduce you to the topic.
